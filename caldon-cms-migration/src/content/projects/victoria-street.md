Victoria Street Development is a contemporary 12-unit residential project in the heart of Port Macquarie. Located within walking distance to the CBD, beaches, and essential amenities, this development addresses the strong demand for quality apartment living in one of NSW's most desirable coastal towns.

The design focuses on maximising the coastal lifestyle, with generous balconies, ocean glimpses from upper levels, and a material palette that complements the natural surroundings. Each unit has been designed to capture cross-ventilation and natural light throughout the day.

## Construction Update

Construction commenced Q1 2025 following strong pre-sales. The project is progressing on schedule with structural works underway. Anticipated completion is Q4 2025, with investor returns projected in line with initial feasibility.
