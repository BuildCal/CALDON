Merton Residences represents a boutique development of eight contemporary townhouses, strategically positioned in an established residential precinct of Taree. The project was conceived to address the growing demand for quality, low-maintenance living options in the Manning Valley region.

Each townhouse has been thoughtfully designed to maximise natural light and cross-ventilation, with private outdoor spaces and secure parking. The development incorporates modern architectural principles while respecting the character of the surrounding neighbourhood.

## Investment Outcome

The project achieved strong pre-sales prior to construction commencement, with all units settled within 60 days of practical completion.
